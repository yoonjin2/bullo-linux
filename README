Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

Great Pleasure, without aging our brain and heart. Greater roots is from RoK(but originally from Zhou, China).
머리와 마음만은 늙지 않아 기쁘다.

This is Yinyang modified linux kernel for LG Gram, with Network-daemonized IChing. Be sure to check IChing in my repo lists.

Yin is minus, Yang is plus. If you succeed in this experiment, you will get more.
